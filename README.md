# Ecological and Taxonomic Analysis

The goal of this page is to document the tools in R that are best used for analyzing large sets of ecological data. While the current scope of thw wepage is limited to ecological data, I would greatly like to extend toward other areas of statistical analysis, considering the importance of genomic data in relation to taxonomic trees.

Analyzing large sets of ecological data is crucial for understanding the complex interactions within ecosystems and developing evidence-based strategies for conservation and management. Large data sets allow for more robust statistical analysis and modeling, providing valuable insights into the functioning of ecosystems, identifying patterns and relationships, and monitoring changes in biodiversity and ecosystem services.

## Current Projects

 - Quantitative analysis on the restoration of native vegetation in agricultural landscapes and its effects on reversing the loss of biodiversity.
 

## Future Project Goals


 - Analyzing transcriptomic data from neurons to identify genes that are differentially expressed during specific phases of signaling pathways.
 
 - Developing computational models to simulate neuron signaling events and predict the effects of gene expression changes on signaling pathways.
 
 - Using bioinformatics tools to analyze epigenetic modifications that affect gene expression in neurons during different signaling events.
